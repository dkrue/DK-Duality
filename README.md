## About
This is one of my high-quality projects I have made several times and sell in my
[Etsy Store: Circuits & Sawdust](https://www.etsy.com/listing/497260569/duality-handmade-usb-midi-controller).

## How it works
This is a [Teensy LC](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) based USB MIDI controller with 2 potentiometers, 2 color changing LEDs, and several smoothing algorithms in the code to provide quality MIDI signals. It is programmed within Arduino, and extended by my own C++ classes to manage the knob values, LEDs, and value scaling across my collection of MIDI projects.

## Feedback
I've made several improvements to the code based on customer feedback and having other people use it with different equipment.
